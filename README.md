## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering specializing in emerging computing technologies. My research focuses on advancing two critical but underdeveloped areas in emerging technologies: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and computer architecture. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in both flexible and superconducting computing technologies.

Currently, I am working with Professor George Tzimpragos on groundbreaking research in superconducting computing and flexible electronics. My work spans from developing resource-efficient superconducting circuits to architecting bespoke accelerators for flexible electronics.

## Research Projects

### Superconducting Computing
I am currently working on advancing superconducting electronics in two main directions: enabling efficient quantum computing integration and extending our synthesis methodologies for superconducting circuits. This builds on my previous work where I developed synthesis support a clock-free superconducting logic scheme using insights from And-Inverter-Graphs and domino logic. That approach, published at DAC 2024, achieved an 80% reduction in required Josephson junctions compared to traditional Rapid SFQ implementations. I'm now focusing on advancing these techniques while exploring new architectures for quantum computing integration and novel memory technologies.

### Flexible Electronics and Bespoke Accelerators
In my undergraduate research, I developed techniques for architecting bespoke accelerators for classifiers in flexible electronics. This work addressed the unique challenges of flexible electronics, which enable low-cost (sub-cent) manufacturing but must support intermittent computation with constrained logic resources. I developed model-specific hardware where classifier parameters are hardwired into circuits during synthesis, significantly reducing overhead. The work, focusing on Binary and Ternary Neural Networks, explored various approximation techniques and optimized cross-neuron logic sharing, leading to a publication at ICCAD 2024. I plan to further explore applications of flexible electronics in future projects, particularly in medical contexts.
